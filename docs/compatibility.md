# Blob Compatibility Evidence

The first slice supports canonical SHA-1 blobs in loose storage. The caller supplies an object
directory and its known `ObjectFormat::Sha1` format. The library rejects `ObjectFormat::Sha256`; it
does not read repository configuration. Crate Rustdoc owns the API examples and complete
limitations.

## References and Provenance

The format references are [Git Objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects)
and [Git's hash transition document](https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition). Blob
identity hashes the uncompressed header and content. Loose files contain a zlib stream, located
under the first two hexadecimal identity digits and a filename containing the remaining digits.

Implementation and tests are original. No Git source, test code, or comments were copied or adapted.
`tests/blobs.rs` generates empty, text, binary, and malformed inputs at runtime. Its fixed
`ABC_LOOSE` byte array was independently generated with Python's `zlib.compress(b"blob 3\0abc")`. A
complete-read case validates that fixture; named cases test all 18 incomplete prefixes. No fixture
files are vendored.

Run `cargo test` with Git available on `PATH`. Interoperability tests create isolated bare SHA-1
repositories using `git init --bare --object-format=sha1 --template=`. They compare identities with
`git hash-object --stdin`, read girt-written objects with `git cat-file blob`, then remove those
loose files and regenerate them using `git hash-object -w --stdin` for girt to read. Tests remove
inherited `GIT_*` environment overrides and disable system/global config for child processes. They
do not modify global configuration or the working checkout. This slice was validated with Git 2.55.0
on macOS; other platforms have not been exercised.

## Independent Unit-Test Identities

- `src/object.rs` checks exact headers at 9/10-byte and 99/100-byte decimal transitions, using
  repeated `x` bytes. A fifth case preserves every byte value from 0 through 255, including NUL and
  non-UTF-8 bytes.
- Each named case compares the complete encoding with a literal header plus the original payload,
  and the identity with a literal expected SHA-1 value. Expected values are not computed by girt.
- The constants were established with Python 3.14.7 `hashlib` and independently cross-checked with
  Git 2.55.0. The empty-blob identity remains covered by the existing doctest.
- Reproduce the constants outside a repository with this script; all temporary state is disposable:

```python
import hashlib
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile

fixtures = [b"x" * size for size in (9, 10, 99, 100)] + [bytes(range(256))]
env = {key: value for key, value in os.environ.items() if not key.startswith("GIT_")}
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
    env.update(GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM="1", GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.path.join(directory, "absent"))
    for content in fixtures:
        encoded = b"blob " + str(len(content)).encode("ascii") + b"\0" + content
        expected = hashlib.sha1(encoded).hexdigest()
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "hash-object", "--stdin"], input=content, cwd=directory, env=env,
            check=True, capture_output=True,
        )
        assert result.stdout.decode().strip() == expected
        print(len(content), expected)
```

## Validation Boundaries

Tests cover empty and binary content, exact read limits, missing objects, unsupported formats and
object types, malformed headers and lengths, wrong identities, every truncation of a small
compressed object, invalid checksums, trailing bytes, and concatenated streams. Publication tests
cover repeated and concurrent writes, existing corrupt objects, and failed publication with
temporary-file cleanup.

Reads require canonical decimal lengths and complete zlib streams. They reject malformed encodings
rather than emulate Git's tolerance for unusual inputs. Compressed bytes can differ from Git's
output; identity and decoded bytes must agree. This slice does not implement collision detection,
packed objects, alternates, power-loss durability, shared-repository permissions, or protection
against a hostile filesystem owner. File publication requires hard-link support.

Performance commands, cache conditions, results, and limitations are recorded in the
[blob benchmark baseline](benchmarks.md).

## Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are `sha1` for hashing, `flate2` for zlib, `tempfile` for exclusive temporary
files and disposable test directories, and `thiserror` for error derivation. All four declare
`MIT OR Apache-2.0`. Requirements permit compatible releases within their selected release series;
the lockfile records tested versions.

`rstest` provides test parameterization and Criterion provides benchmark sampling and analysis. Both
are development-only dependencies with MIT/Apache-2.0 license alternatives.

The resolved dependency manifests were checked with `cargo metadata --format-version 1`. Resolved
packages offer MIT, Apache-2.0, or Zlib terms, including platform-specific dependencies;
`unicode-ident` also requires Unicode-3.0 terms. `simd-adler32` and `generic-array` use MIT;
`zlib-rs` uses Zlib. License alternatives in transitive packages do not require selecting LGPL. This
records package metadata, not an independent legal audit.
